       "'long since dead that i want you to begin as soon as possible to reap the benefits mr intended for you to this refused to listen though he began to think he had been rude to the man of the law he persisted that if mr had intended him to have two thousand five hundred dollars a year or any sum from his estate he would have made his will in that manner instead of that he should wait five years and then depend upon a he would have been glad now had the will read differently he did not like to be left face to face with poverty but his honor was in becoming a tact and he had not yet experienced that sharp contact with the world which it i will take nothing but what is mine he said in response to every argument but i owe you an apology for my manner of receiving the unpleasant news you broke to me yesterday and i make it freely and now can you think of any situation which i could fill for i want to with out delay to earn my bread mr after casting about in his mind a few moments said he could think of nothing at present but would make some inquiries in the meantime gray would do well to look about for himself with this understanding they parted at the end of a month though he had looked about with diligence had found absolutely nothing that he could do and his distress increased as he went from place to place and saw his for the positions offered he went to mr office again in a much frame of mind than before and told that gentleman frankly what had occurred this leads me to make you an offer on my own account said the lawyer gravely which i should otherwise have hesitated to do i am a very busy man and have now with mr s estate and others that are in my charge more than i can attend to just at present i think you could if you chose be of some assistance in caring for my trust property collecting rents seeing to etc as well as making journeys to various places and looking into matters that require attention for this work i am not able to offer you a large compensation but love gone astray it might keep you occupied until something better turns up i will take it gladly was the quick reply the prospect of earning anything whatever seeming too good to be lost you are very kind to make the proposition but to this mr saying it was wholly a business matter with him and he wanted it treated as such he was willing to pay fifteen dollars a week with necessary expense of travel etc and possibly the salary might be raised to twenty later gray seized upon the offer without more and it was arranged that he should begin his duties the very next morning never having had the slightest business experience it is doubtful if the young man ever really earned the meagre salary which he began to receive but he brought to the work an honesty of purpose and a of conduct if mr had been wholly in him the connection might have gone on much longer than it did to the mutual advantage of both the fact was however that the engagement was only a scheme on the lawyer s part for bringing gray to the agreement he had first suggested mr believed thoroughly that this was the only sensible thing for him to do and felt that the obstinacy with which he held out deserved to be overcome if he could reduce the youth to actual want and then give him no other alternative than to accept his offer he believed he would be doing him a real kindness but gray proved a subject to handle he lived after a fashion on the fifteen dollars a becoming a week that was paid him and all offers to take the first penny from his inheritance then who knew that mr had never believed his nephew alive and had only intended to give this young man a little experience of the value of money determined to force matters he therefore announced to gray one day that he should not need his services after the following week somewhat but not at all ready to give up looked about for another situation and soon heard of one at a fair salary in where a concern wanted just the sort of man he conceived himself to be one acquainted with america and able to talk a certain line of goods into americans travelling abroad correspondence passed and he was advised to come to holland at once arriving there he was given the position and held it just three weeks by which time both he and his were satisfied that he was wholly for its duties the termination of the engagement that naturally followed did not include a payment of a return fare across the ocean and he walked out of the office in a very low frame of mind at his lodging was a letter from the offer to loan him whatever money he needed in case he ever should get short of funds he tore it up in a violent rage and stamped on it with his feet i will live on a crust a day and finally die of in a garret he exclaimed before i will accept of a dollar from that man and he began to carry out his he went to london where he hired the poorest lodging he love gone astray could find and dined in his room on the food while he followed all possible that seemed to offer a chance to earn a living however poor at last he almost made up his mind to take a passage home the only one '"
